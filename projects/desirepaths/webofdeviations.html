    <p>A desire line is an unofficial path created by erosion caused by repeated use. They are traces of use or wear that indicate preferred methods of interaction with places or systems. The force of desire is productive in its ability to reorient, fuel and generate alternative landscapes. But desire is not a one-way street. We both make places and are made by them through a continuous co-constitutive, relational process. How does desire create surfaces and boundaries? How are we shaped by its affects?</p>
