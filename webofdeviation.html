        <p> A desire line is an unofficial path created by erosion caused by repeated use. They are traces of use or wear that indicate preferred methods of interaction with places or systems. The force of desire is productive in its ability to reorient, fuel and generate alternative landscapes. But desire is not a one-way street. We both make places and are made by them through a continuous co-constitutive, relational process. How does desire create surfaces and boundaries? How are we shaped by its affects?

<p>The force of desire is productive in its ability to reorient, fuel and generate alternate landscapes. Desire lines are the manifestation of a common will inscribing itself on space which is dominated by logics of control and governance - where people deviate from the paths they are supposed to follow. 
    <p></p>But desire is not a one-way street. It is entangled and distributed, and desire lines are constituted by an encounter - a co-production between someone who desires something and whatever it is that pulls them to have and/or act on that desire. We both make places and are made by them through a continuous co-constitutive, relational process. Often deviating onto grass away from pavement, desire lines are traces of a departure from the grid. Grids, as ordering systems and default arrangements, structure and limit how people move through the world - virtual or not. These governing structures define and regulate the fabric of our interactions.</p>
